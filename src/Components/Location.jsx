                Sumba is located in Indonesia, just an hourâ€™s flight from Bali
                and Lombok. This exotic island has two airports. The closest to
                our city, Tambolaka, is only 35 km away. <br />
                <br />
                 Sumba provides a rare
                sense of discovery, where ancient tribal culture and unspoiled
                natural beauty form a backdrop to an experience of unregulated
                freedom, understated luxury, and unforgettable memories.
